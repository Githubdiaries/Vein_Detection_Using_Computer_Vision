Here’s a clean, professional **GitHub README-style project description** for your **Vein Detection System**:

---

## 🩸 Vein Detection System – OpenCV Based

A low-cost, non-invasive **Computer Vision system** to enhance and detect human veins using **Python and OpenCV**. This project is a prototype for potential use in healthcare diagnostics, educational demonstrations, and medical device innovation in low-resource settings.

### 🔧 Features

* Image-based vein detection using contrast and channel enhancement
* Works on standard smartphone-captured images
* No expensive hardware or infrared needed
* Easily extensible with machine learning for improved accuracy

### 📁 Files

* `vein_detect_image.py`: Base image processing pipeline
* `enhance.py`: Enhanced contrast and channel manipulation logic
* `v_enh_3.py`: Experimented version with different enhancement parameters

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* OpenCV 🎥
* NumPy

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python vein_detect_image.py
```

Make sure your image file is in the same directory, and update the path in the script if needed.

### 📸 Input Format

Use clear images of the skin taken under good lighting (preferably with visible vein contours).

### 📌 Status

✅ Functional prototype
🛠️ Open to improvements (real-time video stream, ML enhancement, mobile adaptation)
